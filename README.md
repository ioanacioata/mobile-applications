## Project Description

Create a mobile application that tracks your spendings, and shows an overview of your budget. The application should be implemented both in React Native and Android native (i.e. two implementations should be handled). 

## Authentification 
There will be two user types.
- regular user :  Can sign up. Can log into application. Can request a new password by email (if forgotten). Can edit personal data (name profile picture, weight, height, etc) and change application settings. Can input items that the user bought, with their price and the store. Can add other spendings - such as rent, electricity, water etc. Can view charts of his the spending inputed and reports like : most money spended on a type of food, best price the user and other users encountered, of a certain product, in a certain store. 

-admin : can log into the application. Can do crud operations on the categories of the spendings, can add stores.

## Shopping list
A user can have a button - create shopping list and add products, and can update the price of that product in that supermarket if it is not correct.
The user can open a Google map - showing the shops he bought from in the last month and the amount spent or he can search for a product and a map showing the price for that product at every known store in the city. 

## Share
The user can share the details of a product at a certain store, or can share a shopping list via mail.

## Others
Animations will be present for transitions between pages.
