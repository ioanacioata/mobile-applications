## Project Description

The application would be designed for helping managers supervise the employees in a company and to help organizing the teams working there. 

There would be users and each of them would have a profile, with a name, profile picture and their job title. 

The manager can set at the beginning some goals he wants to achieve, in a given period of time. For each of these goals a team can be assigned and he can set some KPIs, which are calculated by the application, such that he can estimate if the goal can be achieved on time. 

This application is made to ensure the workflow of the projects: it can ensure the the daily 15 minutes meeting is held for every team until a given hour. At this meeting several questions, for each team member, are answered and noted in the application: 
 - is yesterday's goal achieved? 
 - which is the task for today? 
 
 Also, the elements considered significant for the computation of the KPI are noted here. For example, for a sales team, an example of this would be the number of calls that were made in the previous day.

 The manager can also configure this part and change or add other questions.

There can be a weekly meeting, registered in the application, where other relevant questions are answered, for example:
-what went wrong in the previous week?
-what can we do to improve our workflow? 

 The users have different roles: 
 - team lead - the one the holds the daily meeting, only he can start it, and he is the one that introduces the data
 - team member - they can only observe their activity and their team member's activity
 - observer - can see the activity of all the projects and see their status

 The manager can see the progress of any ongoing project, at any time, and see, at a glance, if anyone is having trouble with their daily tasks. He can also add some alerts and receive email, for example, if the meetings are not held until a certain hour or if a certain target that was set is not going to be achieved, based on the predictions made from the KPIs.

 The manager can use the application for other companies or other projects he owns, as well, and see their status, in the same manner.
